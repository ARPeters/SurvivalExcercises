Then if the no-interaction model is used, it will not be possible to \n#    separate out the effects of predictors within each stratum representing the recurring events on a given subject.\n#    TRUE\n\n#13) In choosing betwen the conditional 1 and the marginal approaches, the marginal approach would be preferred provided the different strata \n#    clearly represent different event types.\n#    TRUE\n\n#14) When using an interaction stratified Cox model to analyze recurrent event data, the estimated regression coefficients and corresponding \n#    standard errors for the first stratum always will be identical for conditional 1, conditional 2, and marginal approaches. \n#    TRUE\n\n#15) The choice among the Counting Process, conditional 1, conditional 2, and marginal approaches depends upon whether a no-interaction \n#    stratified Cox or an interaction stratified Cox model is more appropriate for one's data. \n#    FALSE\n\n#16) Suppose that Allie, Sally, and Callie are the only three subjects in the dataset shown below.

Describe the LR test used \n#   for the marginal model (full and reduced models, null hypothesis, test-statistic, distribution of test statistic \n#   under the null).\n\n#   The likelihood ratio is a test statistic of goodness of fit, comparing a full and reduced model. The test statistic,\n#   -2ln(Likelihood(full)/Likelihood(reduced)) follows an approximate chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom\n#   equal to the difference in the number of parameters of each model. In this case, the full model includes the \n#   predictor variables treatment (tx), smoking, and an interaction between the strata and the two predictor variables (B3 & B4),\n#   and the reduced model would contain only the first two parameters, B1 and B2. Using the likelihood statistics for each model,\n#   we conduct the likelihood ratio and compare it to a chi-squared distribution with 2 (four paramaters - 2 paramaters) degrees\n#   of freedom. The p-value of this statistic is then used to test the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference\n#   between these two models (i.e. that there is no interaction effect between strata and predictor variables).\n\n#E) How can you criticize the use of a no-interaction Stratified Cox model for any of the Stratified Cox appraoches, despite \n#   finding that the above likelihood ratio test was not significant?\n\n#   Any model that includes interaction models between strata and predictor variables is necessarly controlling for such interactions\n#   when estimating other parameters. Even if the interactions are not significant, including them in the model can still produce\n#   more accurate estimates of the other parameters in the model. \n\n#F) Based on the study description given earlier, wy does it make sense to recommend the Cox Proportional approach \n#   over the other alternative approaches?\n\n#   Because the researchers are considering each event as being the same type of event, and are not interested in the\n#   order of events. \n\n#G) Under what circumstances would you recommend using the Marginal approach instead of the Cox Proportional Hazard approach?\n\n#   You would use the Marginal approach when you are interested in categorically different events, and consider\n#   all subjects to be at risk for each type of event from the start of observation. \n\n#H) In table T.2, why does the number in the risk set remain unchanged through failure time 68, even though \n#   50 events occur up to that time?\n\n#   Table T.2 shows survival times of subjects from start date up until their third event, but the researchers in this case\n#   are apparently not interested in the order of events. All subjects remain in a single risk set until their third event. \n#   Any subject who failed was still considered \"at risk\" until their third event. \n\n#I) Why does the number in the risk set change from 31 to 26 when going from time 96 to 97?\n\n#   Because five subjects experience their third and final event on day 96, and are removed from the risk set.\n\n#J) Why is the number of failures equal to 3 and the number of censored subjects tqual to 1 in the interval \n#   between failure times 79 and 80?\n\n#   Because subject 9 is censored at time t=79, and subjects 15, 16, and 28 all experience their final event at\n#   time t=79.\n\n#K) What 5 subjects were censored in the the interval between failure times 111 and 112?\n\n#   Subjects 4, 14, 15, 24, and 29.\n\n#L) Describe the eventhistory for subject 5, including his/her effect on changes in the risk set.\n\n#  Subject 5 experiences their first and second event at times t=45 and t=68 respectively. After that,\n#  they were apparently lost to follow up, and are no longer part of the risk set. \n\n#M) Suppose the survival probabilities shown in table T.3 are plotted on the y-axis versus corresponding ordered\n#   failure times on the x-axis. What is plotted by such a curve?\n\n#   iii: Pr(T>t) where T = time to any event from study entry.\n\n#N) Can you criticize the use of the product limit formula for S(t(f)) in table T.3? Explain briefly?\n\n#   This use of the product limit formula depends upon all subjects being part of a single risk set.\n#   In not stratifying on event order (and not including interactions between strata and predictors)\n#   estimates of survival probabilities are based on the assumption that the order of events has no effect\n#   on survival probabilities or parameter estimates. \n\n#O) \n#i)     tf  nf  mf  qf  S(t(f))\n#       51  7   2   0   (5/7)*.19=0.14\n#       57  5   2   0   (3/5)*.14=0.084\n#       58  3   2   0   (1/3)*.084=.03\n#       60  1   1   0   0\n\n#ii)    tf  nf  mf  qf  S(t(f))\n#       40  6   1   0   (5/6)*.17=.14\n#       41  5   1   0   (4/5)*.14=.11\n#       42  4   1   0   (3/4)*.11=.08\n#       46  3   1   0   (2/3)*.08=.05\n#       47  2   1   0   (1/2)*.05=.025\n\n#iii)   tf  nf  mf  qf  S(t(f))\n#       79  9   4   0   (5/9)*.25=.14\n#       80  7   2   0   (5/7)*.14=.10\n#       81  5   2   0   (3/5)*.1=.06\n#       97  3   2   0   (1/3)*.06=.02\n\n#P) The survival curves corresponding to each of the data layouts (ab, b, c) described in Question O (#14) \n#   will be different. Why?\n\n#   They will be different becuase each is based on a different understanding of the recurring events. The first table,a,\n#   is time until the first event from study entry. The second models survival time until the second event, starting from \n#   the first event; this suggests that the first and second events are fundamentally different, because of their order.\n#   The third table is models time from the start of observation to the second event, suggesting that events 1, 2, and 3 are\n#   all fundamentally different types of events, and that subjects are at risk for all events from the start of observation. \n\n",
