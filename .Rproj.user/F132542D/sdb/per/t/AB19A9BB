Then such deaths from surery reduce the hospital's burden of infection control.\n\n#   TRUE\n\n#5) The typical approach for analyzing competing risks using a Cox PH model involves fitting separate models for\n#   each competing risk ignoring the other competing risks\n\n#   FALSE\n\n#6) Suppose that a cause-specific risk of interest is development of lung metastasis and competing risk is \n#   local recurrence of a lung tumor. Then a patient who develops a local recurrence is treated as a failure\n#   in a competing risk analysis. \n\n#   FALSE\n\n#7) When there are no competing risks, then any study subject in the risk set at a given time has the same risk\n#   for failing as any other subject in the risk set with the same values for covariate predictors at time t. \n\n#   FALSE\n\n#8) If, when analyzing competing risks survival data, it is assumed that censoring is noninformative, then a\n#   subject in the risk set at time t is as likely to fail from any competing risk as to be lost to follow-up\n\n#   TRUE\n\n#9) When a sensitivity analysis indicates that a worst-case scenario gives meaningfully different results from\n#   an analysis that assumes indeendence of competing risks, then there is evidence that the independence\n#   assumption is violated. \n\n#   FALSE\n\n#10)The typical competing risk analysis assumes that competing risks are independent even if this assumption is\n#   not true. \n\n#   TRUE\n\n#11)The Cumulative Inciudence Curve proves risk estimates for the occurence of a cause-specific event in the\n#   presence of competing risks.\n\n#   TRUE\n\n#12)CIC=1-Kaplan-Meier curve\n\n#   FALSE\n\n#13)A CIC for a cause-specific event that ignores the control of covariates does not require the assumption of \n#   independent competing risks. \n\n#   TRUE\n\n#14)A cumulative Probability Curve gives the probability of experiencing an event c by time t, from risk c, \n#   given that an individual has experienced any other competing risks by time t. \n\n#   FALSE\n\n#15)If CIC(sub-c)=.4, then CPC=.4/.6=.667\n\n#   FALSE\n\n#16)The Lunn-McNeil approach fits a single stratified Cox model using an augmented dataset to obtain the same \n#   results as obtained by fitting separate Cox models for each cause-specific competing risk.\n\n#   TRUE\n\n#17)An advantage of the Lunn-McNeil approach over the approach that fits separate Cox models is that the LM \n#   approach allows for testing whether a no-interaction SC model might be preferable to an interaction SC model.\n\n#   TRUE\n\n#18)Given the LM Model stratified on two cause-specific events, cancer and CVD:...\n\n#   TRUE\n\n#19)Given the LM(alt) model for two cause-specific events, cancer and CVD:\n\n#   TRUE\n\n#20)THe LMu model that would result if hte LM model of Quewstion 18 were changed to an unstratified Cox PH\n#   model were changed to an unstratified Cox PH model can be written as follows: \n\n#   FALSE\n\n\n# Consider a hypothetical study of the effect of a bone marrow transplant for leukemia on leukemia-free\n# survival, where transplant failures can be of one of two types: relapse of leukemia and nonrelapse death\n# (without prior relapse of leukemia). Suppose that in a hospital A, 100 patients undergo such a  transplant\n# and that within the first 4 years post-translplant, 60 die without relapse by year 2 and 20 relapse during \n# year 4. Suppose that in hospital B, 100 patients undergo such a transplant but post-transplant, there are \n# 20 non-relapse deaths by year 1, 15 relapss during year 2, 40 non-relapse deaths between years 3 and 4, \n# and 5 relapses during year 4.\n\n#21)What are the competing risks in this study?\n\n#   Leukemia relapse and non-relapse death. \n\n#22)What is the proportion of initial patients in hospitals A and B, respectively, that have leukemia relapse\n#   by 4 years?\n\n#   Hospital A: 20 of the 100 patients, or 0.2\n#   Hospital B: 20 of the 100 patients, or 0.2\n\n#23)How have both tables treated the competing risk for nonrelapse death in the calculation of the KM \n#   probabilities.\n\n#   Both tables treat it as censoring. \n\n#24)Why are the KM Probabilities different at 4 years for each hospital?\n\n#   In hospital A, all of the events and censorings happen at once, leaving just on calculation of KM\n#   at one sample size.\n\n#   In hospital B, the events and censorings happen in two waves. That means that the KM is adjusted at\n#   multiple points in time, with multiple multiple sampling sizes, and is cumulative across the two adjustment\n#   times (i.e. S(t=1), S(t=1)*S(t=2)).\n\n#25)Compute the CIC curves for each hospital using the following tables\n\ntfa<-c(0,2,4)\nnfa<-c(100,40,40)\nmfa<-c(0,0,20)\nhazhata<-c(0,0,0.5)\nsurvhata<-c(NA,1,0.4)\nihata<-c(NA,0,0.2)\nCICa<-c(NA,0,0.2)\ndsA<-cbind(tfa,nfa,mfa,hazhata,survhata,ihata,CICa)\ndsA\n\ntfb<-c(0,1,2,3,4)\nnfb<-c(100,80,80,65,25)\nmfb<-c(0,0,15,0,5)\nhazhatb<-c(0,0,(15/80),0,5/25)\nsurvhatb<-c(NA,1,80/100,65/100,25/100)\nihatb<-c(NA, 0, 0.15, 0, 0.5)\nCICb<-c(NA,0,0.15,0.15,0.20)\ndsB<-cbind(tfb,nfb,mfb,hazhatb,survhatb,ihatb,CICb)\ndsB\n\n#26)Why are the CIC probabilities the same at 4 years?\n\n#   The CIC curves are the same at four years because they give the cumulative risk at each year. While the timing of leukemia\n#   relapses differs across time, the Cumulative Incidence cumulates to the same number at year 4 in both hospitals. \n\n#   Consider a hypothetical study to assess the effect of a new hospital infection control strategy for patients who undergo\n#   heart transplant surgery in a given hospital. The exposure variable of interest is a binary variable Group (G): G = 0 \n#   for those patients receiving heart transplants from 1992 through 1995 when the previous hospital control strategy was used;\n#   G = 1 for those patients receiving heart transplants from 1996 through 1999 when the new hospital infection control strategy \n#   was adopted. The primary event of interest is getting a hospital infection after surgery. A competing risk is death during \n#   recovery from surgery without getting a hospital infection. Control variables being considered are tissue mismatch score (TMS) \n#   at transplant and AGE at transplant. The outcome variable of interest is time (DAYS after surgery) until a patient developed\n#   a hospital infection.\n\n#27)State a cause-specific no-interaction Cox PH model for assessing the effect of group status (G) on time until a hospital infection\n#   event.\n\n# h(t,x)=hnull*exp(B1*TMS + B2*AGE + B3*G); deaths without infection are considered censored. \n\n#28)When fitting hte model given in Question 27, which patients should be censored?\n\n#   Patients who die without a hospital infection are considered censored. \n\n#29)Describe or provide a table that would show how the data on the ith patient should be augmented for input into a Lunn-McNeil model\n#   for analysis. \n\n#   In a Lunn-McNeil model, the table would include two binary outcome events, one for each of the competing risks of interest. \n\n#30)State a Lunn-McNeil model that can be used with an augmented dataset htaht will provide identical results to those obtained\n#   from useing the model of Question 27.\n\n#   h(t,x)=hnull*exp(B1*TMS + B2*AGE + B3*G + B4*D2*TMS + B5*D2*AGE + B6*D2*G);\n#   D2=0 if patient develops an infection\n#   D2=1 if patient dies without infection\n\n#31)For the LM model of Question 30, what is the formula for the hazard ratio for the group effect G, controlling for TMS and AGE\n\n#   haz=exp(B3*G); G=1\n\n#32)Describe how you would test whether a no-interaction SC LM Model would be more appropriate than an interaction SC LM Model\n\n#   You would compare the two with a likelihood ratio: the full model is that of question 30, the reduced model is that of \n#   question 27. You would calculate the likelihood ratio and treat it as a chi-squared stat with 3 degrees of freedom and\n#   use the p-value to accept or reject the null hypothesis that the interaction variables add nothing to the model. \n\n#33)State a Lunn-McNeil model that can be used with an augmented dataset that will provide identical results to those obtained\n#   from usig the model of Question 27.\n\n#   h(t,x)=hnull*exp(B1*D1*TMS + B2*D1*AGE + B3*D1*G + B4*D2*TMS + B5*D2*AGE + B6*D2*G)\n#   D2=0 if patient develops an infection\n#   D2=1 if patient dies without infection\n\n#34)For the LM Model of question 33, what is the formula for hte hazar ratio for the group effect G, controlling for TMS and AGE?\n\n#   haz=exp(B3)\n\n#####################################\n#Test Questions\n#####################################\n\n# The dataset shown below describes a hypothetical study of\n# recurrent bladder cancer.

State a\n#   no-interaction Cox PH model for assessing this relationship\n#   that adjusts for the covariates num and size.\n\n#   haz(x,t)=hnull(x)exp(B1*TX + B2*NUM + B3*Size); events other than local recurrence (event=1) are considered censored.\n\n#2) When fitting the model given in Question 1, which subjects are considered censored?\n\n#   Bladder metastasis (event=2) and other metastasis (event=3) are considered censored. \n\n#3) How would you modify your answers to Questions 1\n#   and 2 if you were interested in the effect of tx on\n#   survival time for the cause-specific event of finding\n#   metastatic bladder cancer?\n\n#   I would treat local recurrence (event=1) and other mestasis (event=3) as censored and fit essentially the same Cox PH model. \n\n#4) For the model considered in Question 1, briefly\n#   describe how to carry out a sensitivity analysis to determine\n#   how badly the results from fitting this model\n#   might be biased if the assumption of independent competing\n#   risks is violated.\n\n#   To see how biased this model might be, we would compare our Cox PH model to those for which the independence assumption has been\n#   thoroughly violated. This could be done by considering all events to be the single event type of interest, or by changing the\n#   survival times of event types 2 and 3 to the last possible time, essentially treating them as event-free. \n#   We would then calculate a Cox PH model for one or both of these assumptions and compare them to the Cox PH model from question 1.\n#   This does not give any evidence of dependence or independence, but it does offer a view of how biased our first model might be\n#   under worst-case conditions. \n\n#5) \ndata9_5tx1<-c(\"0 27 0 0 — — —\n2 27 0 0 1 0 0\n3 26 0 0 .9630 0 0\n4 24 0 0 .8889 0 0\n8 23 1 .0435 .8889 .0387 .0387\n9 21 0 0 .8116 0 .0387\n10 20 0 0 .7729 0 .0387\n15 17 1 .0588 .7343 .0432 .0819\n16 15 0 0 .6479 0 .0819\n18 14 0 0 .6047 0 .0819\n22 12 1 .0833 .6047 .0504 .1323\n23 11 1 .0910 .5543 .0504 .1827\n24 8 1 .1250 .5039 .0630 .2457\n26 7 1 .1429 .4409 .0630 .3087\n28 4 0 0 .3779 0 .3087\n29 2 0 0 .2835 0 .3087\n30 1 0 0 .2835 0 .3087\")\n\nds9_5tx1<-data.frame(matrix(as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(data9_5tx1, split=\"\\\\s|\\\\n\"))), ncol=7,byrow=TRUE))\ncolnames(ds9_5tx1)<-c(\"tf\", \"nf\", \"d1f\", \"h1\" ,\"S1\", \"I1\", \"CIC1\")\nds9_5tx1\n\ndata9_5tx0<-c(\"0 26 0 0 — — —\n1 26 1 .0400 1 .0400 .0400\n2 24 1 .0417 .9615 .0400 .0800\n3 23 2 .0870 .9215 .0801 .1601\n5 21 0 0 .8413 0 .1601\n6 20 0 0 .8013 0 .1601\n7 18 0 0 .7212 0 .1601\n10 16 0 0 .6811 0 .1601\n12 15 1 .0667 .6385 .0426 .2027\n14 13 0 0 .6835 0 .2027\n16 12 1 .0833 .5534 .0461 .2488\n17 10 1 .1000 .4612 .0461 .2949\n18 9 0 0 .4150 0 .2949\n21 8 0 0 .4150 0 .2949\n23 7 0 0 .3632 0 .2949\n25 6 1 .1667 .3632 .0605 .3554\n29 4 0 0 .2421 0 .3554\n30 2 1 0 .2421 0 .3554\")\n\n\nds9_5tx0<-data.frame(matrix(as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(data9_5tx0, split=\"\\\\s|\\\\n\"))), ncol=7,byrow=TRUE))\ncolnames(ds9_5tx0)<-c(\"tf\", \"nf\", \"d1f\", \"h1\" ,\"S1\", \"I1\", \"CIC1\")\nds9_5tx0\n\n#5A)  Verify the CIC1 calculation provided at failure time\n#     tf = 8 for persons in the treatment group (tx = 1);\n#     that is, use the original data to compute h1(tf), S(tf1),\n#     I1(tf), and CIC1(tf), assuming that the calculations\n#     made up to this failure time are correct.\n\n#     h1(tf=8)  = (1/23) =  0.04347\n#     S(tf1=8)  = (26/27)*(24/26) = 0.88889\n#     I1(tf=8)  = (h1(tf=8))*(S1(tf=8))=(1/23)*(24/27)=0.03865\n#     CIC(tf=8) = 0 + 0.03865 = 0.03865\n",
